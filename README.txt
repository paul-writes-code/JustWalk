Walking into an Enemy (Red Circle) will begin combat. Entering combat will earn you XP, leveling you up.
Leveling up will grant you skill points which can be used in the Traits Screen ('T' by Default).
NPCs may also drop loot, such as armour, and money. Picking up drops (SPACE by Default) will automatically
place them in the next available slot of the player inventory, as long as there is space.

Player is the Green Circle.
The Level Boss is the Black Circle.

Walking into a Shopkeeper (Blue Circle) will open trade. You can trade all the items in you inventory for money and
use your money to purchase items from the shopkeeper.

The traits window is used to manage skill points earned from leveling up. These traits help defeat your enemies with greater ease.
